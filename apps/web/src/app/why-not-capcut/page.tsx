									Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									You probably use CapCut and think your video editing is
									special. You think your fucking TikTok with 47 transitions and
									12 different fonts is going to get you some viral fame. You
									think loading up every goddamn effect in their library makes
									your content better. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe what
									CapCut actually gives you:
								</p>
								<ul className="mb-6 list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-lg">
									<li>A paywall every time you breathe</li>
									<li>Terms of service that steal your shit</li>
									<li>
										More "Get Pro" dialogs than a Windows 95 error message
									</li>
									<li>
										Features that disappear behind paywalls while you're fucking
										using them
									</li>
									<li>Bugs disguised as "premium features"</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									<strong>Well guess what, motherfucker:</strong>
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									You. Are. Getting. Scammed. Look at this shit. It's a fucking
									video editor. Why the fuck do you need to pay $20/month just
									to remove a goddamn watermark? You spent hours editing your
									video and they slap their logo on it like they fucking made
									it.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">
									The "Get Pro" dialog is everywhere
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									This motherfucking dialog pops up more than ads on a pirated
									movie site. Want to add a transition? Get Pro. Want to export
									without their watermark? Get Pro. Want to use more than 2
									fonts? Get fucking Pro, peasant.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Did you seriously think you could edit a video without seeing
									this dialog 47 times? You click one button and BAM - there it
									is again, asking for your credit card like a desperate ex
									asking for money.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">
									Everything costs money now
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									You dumbass. You thought CapCut was free, but no. Free means
									they let you open the app. Everything else costs money. Basic
									shake effect? That'll be $20/month. A decent transition that
									isn't "fade"? Pay up, motherfucker.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Here's my favorite piece of bullshit: You import an MP3 file -
									you know, AUDIO - and try to export. "Sorry, can't export
									because you're using our premium extract audio feature!"
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									<strong>
										My MP3 was already fucking audio, you absolute morons.
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									But wait, there's more! If you drag that same MP3 to their
									media panel first, then to the timeline, it magically works.
									This isn't a bug, it's a fucking scam disguised as software
									engineering.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">
									Their Terms of Service are insane
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Look at this shit. You upload your content and they basically
									say "thanks for the free content, we own it now, but if Disney
									sues anyone, that's your problem."
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									<strong>CapCut's Terms of Service:</strong> We get full rights
									to use, modify, distribute, and monetize everything you upload
									- permanently and without paying you shit. But you're still
									responsible if anything goes wrong.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Translation: "We'll make money off your viral video, you
									handle the lawsuits." Brilliant legal strategy, you fucks.
								</p>

							<div>
								<h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">
									The editor is actually good
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Here's the thing that makes me want to punch my monitor: the
									actual video editor is fucking good. It's intuitive, powerful,
									and anyone can figure it out. When it's not begging for money
									every 30 seconds, it actually works well.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Which makes everything else so much worse. They built
									something people want to use, then turned it into a digital
									slot machine. Every click might trigger a payment request.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">
									This is a video editor. Look at it. You've never seen one
									before.
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									Like the person who's never used software that doesn't
									constantly beg for money, you have no fucking idea what a
									video editor should be. All you've ever seen are predatory
									apps disguised as creative tools.
								</p>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									A real video editor lets you edit videos. It doesn't steal
									your content. It doesn't pop up payment dialogs every 5
									seconds. It doesn't charge you separately for basic features
									that should be free.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h2 className="mb-6 font-bold text-3xl">
									Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck
								</h2>
								<p className="mb-6 text-lg">
									I'm not actually saying all video editors should be basic as
									shit. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with
									video editing apps are{" "}
									<strong>ones they create themselves</strong>. Video editors
									aren't broken by default - they edit videos, export them, and
									let you use basic features without constantly begging for
									money. CapCut breaks them. They turn them into payment
									processors with video editing as a side feature.
